# Pilgrimage-Guide
An web and ML based application that helps the pilgrims to help them to plan accurately by detecting the  exact time taken for their visit

ï‚—	By taking the data from the pilgrims like the month date they are going to visit and number of people they are planning to visit we will predict the time taken for dharshan as the crowd depends on the month and in the temples there may be different poojas according to the month and so the dharshan time will be different for different months so we are calculating the time for every month and from this we are getting more than 90% accuracy
